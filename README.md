# Tower-Of-Hanoi-Game-ColoredRingsGame
This project is an implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem or colored rings game designed using C# language and in the console environment. This project was designed as part of my student project for a data structure course at university.
In this game, we have at least 3 and at most 15 rods or columns. We also have at least 2 and at most 35 rings (however, I used numbers instead of rods in the console environment).
The numbers are placed on the columns in an unbalanced way. You have to arrange the numbers in ascending order, for example from 1 to 10, to complete the game.
