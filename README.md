# Tower-Of-Hanoi-Game-ColoredRingsGame

This project is an implementation of the **Tower of Hanoi** problem or **colored rings game** designed using **C#** language and in the console environment.

This project was designed as part of my student project for a data structure course at university.

In this game, we have at least 3 and at most 15 rods or columns. We also have at least 2 and at most 35 rings (however, I used numbers instead of rods in the console environment).

The numbers are placed on the columns in an unbalanced way. You have to arrange the numbers in **ascending** order, for example from 1 to 10, to complete the game.


## How to use:

- When you run the project, this Console screen will be displayed:

---

- At first, you must specify the number of columns and numbers (or rings)
- First, you specify the number of columns and press enter, and then you specify the number of rings(Numbers) and press enter:

> Minimum value of columns should be 3 due to game rules and Maximum value is 15 because otherwise does not fit in console window.

> Minimum value of rings should be 2 due to game rules and Maximum value is 35 because otherwise does not fit in console window.

- For example, in the image above, I set the number of columns to 3 and the number of rings to 9, now we can see the result:
