# Tower-Of-Hanoi-Game-ColoredRingsGame

This project is an implementation of the **Tower of Hanoi** problem or **colored rings game** designed using **C#** language and in the console environment.

This project was designed as part of my student project for a data structure course at university.

In this game, we have at least 3 and at most 15 rods or columns. We also have at least 2 and at most 35 rings (however, I used numbers instead of rods in the console environment).

The numbers are placed on the columns in an unbalanced way. You have to arrange the numbers in **ascending** order, for example from 1 to 10, to complete the game.


## How to use:

- When you run the project, this Console screen will be displayed:

- At first, you must specify the number of **columns** and **numbers** (or rings)
- First, you specify the number of columns and press enter, and then you specify the number of rings(Numbers) and press enter:

> Minimum value of columns should be 3 due to game rules and Maximum value is 15 because otherwise does not fit in console window.

> Minimum value of rings should be 2 due to game rules and Maximum value is 35 because otherwise does not fit in console window.

- For example, in the image above, I set the number of columns to **3** and the number of rings to **9**, now we can see the result:

- In another example, I set the number of columns to **10** and the number of rings to **25**, and we can see the result in the image below:

- At this point, you will see at the bottom of the picture that you are asked to specify how to solve this game, whether you will solve it yourself or you want the computer to solve it by itself.

- If you type the number 1 and then press enter, you can play the game and solve the problem yourself. But if you type the number 2 and then press enter, the computer will solve it
